Event Delegation is a technique in JavaScript where a single event listener is added to a parent element to handle events on its child elements. This leverages event bubbling, where events propagate from child to parent elements.

Benefits:
Performance: Reduces the number of event listeners, especially for dynamically created elements.
Dynamic Elements: Automatically handles events for elements added dynamically after the listener is set.
Simplified Code: Centralizes event handling logic.
