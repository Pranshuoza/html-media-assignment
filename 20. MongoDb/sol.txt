1. What is a Schema in MongoDB?
MongoDB is schema-less, meaning it doesnâ€™t require a predefined structure for documents in a collection.
However, schemas are often used with ODMs like Mongoose to define and enforce consistent structures for documents.
A schema in MongoDB specifies:
The fields and their data types.
Validation rules.
Default values and other field constraints.
2. Defining and Enforcing Schemas Using Mongoose
Defining Schemas: Mongoose allows developers to define schemas using its Schema class. You define fields, their types, and optional constraints like required fields or default values.
Enforcing Schemas: When a schema is associated with a Mongoose model, documents created or updated using that model must adhere to the schema.
3.Create a Database:
MongoDB automatically creates a database when you first use it (e.g., insert a document).
Drop a Database:
Use the db.dropDatabase() command to delete a database.
4.Create a Collection: Use db.createCollection() or insert a document into a non-existent collection.
Drop a Collection: Use db.collection.drop() to remove it.
