justify-content

Controls the alignment of flex items along the main axis (horizontal for a row layout, vertical for a column layout).
Common values include flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, and space-around.
Example: justify-content: center; centers items along the main axis.

align-items

Aligns flex items along the cross axis (vertical for a row layout, horizontal for a column layout).
Common values include flex-start, flex-end, center, baseline, and stretch.
Example: align-items: stretch; makes all items fill the cross-axis dimension.

gap

Sets the spacing between flex items along the main and cross axes.
Unlike margin, it automatically spaces items without affecting their alignment.
Example: gap: 10px; adds 10 pixels of space between items in both directions.

flex-direction

Specifies the direction of the main axis along which items are placed in the container.
Values include row, row-reverse, column, and column-reverse.
Example: flex-direction: column; arranges items in a vertical column.

flex-wrap

Controls whether flex items wrap onto multiple lines when they overflow the container.
Common values include nowrap (default, items stay on one line), wrap (items wrap onto new lines), and wrap-reverse.
Example: flex-wrap: wrap; allows items to break into a new row if necessary.
