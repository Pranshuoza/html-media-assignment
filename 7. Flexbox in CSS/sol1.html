The CSS Flexbox model is a one-dimensional layout system that aligns items in a single row or column, making it ideal for smaller UI components like navigation bars. Flexbox is content-driven and adjusts items based on their content and available space.

The CSS Grid model is a two-dimensional layout system that allows for precise control of both rows and columns, making it suitable for complex page layouts like galleries and dashboards. Grid is layout-driven and lets you define the overall structure, placing items in specific grid cells.
