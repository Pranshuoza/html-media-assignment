In CSS, absolute and relative positioning are two different ways to control how elements are placed
on a webpage. Relative positioning means an element is positioned relative to its original place 
in the document flow. When you apply `top`, `right`, `bottom`, or `left` properties to a relatively positioned
element, it moves based on its original position without affecting other elements around it. The
element still occupies its original space, so the layout doesn’t shift, and there’s a “gap”
in its original location. 

On the other hand, absolute positioning means an element is positioned relative to its closest positioned 
ancestor (i.e., an ancestor with a `position` value other than `static`). If no such ancestor exists,
the element is positioned relative to the initial containing block, usually the viewport. An absolutely positioned
element is completely removed from the document flow, so it doesn’t occupy space and can overlap with other elements. This type of positioning allows for more precise control of placement, but can lead to overlapping
issues if not managed carefully. Both positioning types are often used together to create complex layouts where elements
need specific placements.
