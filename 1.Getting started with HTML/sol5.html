<!DOCTYPE html>

<!--
It is an instruction that appears at the very beginning of an HTML document, before any other tags.
 It tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in and ensures that the browser
  renders the document in standards-compliant mode. This mode prevents browsers from applying "quirks mode,"
   a less standardized way of interpreting HTML that was necessary for compatibility with older web content.
