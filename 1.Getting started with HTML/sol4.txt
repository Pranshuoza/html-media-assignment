In HTML, tags and elements are essential components for building web content. 
A tag is a keyword enclosed within angle brackets, like <p>, which marks the start and
end of an HTML element, defining the type of content it represents. Tags usually come in pairs,
with an opening tag (e.g., <p>) and a corresponding closing tag (e.g., </p>), where the closing 
tag has a forward slash to signify the end. An element, on the other hand, is the complete structure
consisting of the opening tag, the content, and the closing tag, giving the content its defined 
purpose and structure within the document. For example, in `<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>`, 
<p> is the opening tag, </p> is the closing tag, and together, they form a paragraph element that
 contains the text "This is a paragraph element."
