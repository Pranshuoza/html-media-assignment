What is Express.js?
Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of creating a web server, managing routes, handling requests and responses, and integrating middleware.

Key Features of Express.js
Routing:

Simplifies the process of handling URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
Enables dynamic URL patterns and route parameters.
Middleware Support:

Middleware functions process requests between receiving and sending a response.
Pre-built middleware (e.g., body-parser, cookie-parser) and custom middleware are supported.
Template Engine Support:

Integrates with template engines like Pug, EJS, and Handlebars for rendering dynamic HTML pages.
Scalability:

Designed for creating scalable, modular applications with features like routers and middleware chaining.
Extensive Ecosystem:

Works seamlessly with third-party libraries available through npm.
Error Handling:

Provides an easy-to-implement mechanism for catching and handling application errors.
Why is Express.js Commonly Used in Web Development?
Simplifies Node.js Development:

Building a server in plain Node.js requires extensive boilerplate code. Express abstracts much of this complexity.
Flexibility:

Allows developers to structure their applications according to their needs.
Performance:

Lightweight and fast, as it is built on Node.js's non-blocking I/O model.
REST API Development:

Ideal for creating RESTful APIs due to its built-in routing and middleware capabilities.
Large Community:

Extensive documentation, tutorials, and community support make it beginner-friendly and reliable.
Integration with Databases:

Works well with databases like MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, making it suitable for full-stack development.
