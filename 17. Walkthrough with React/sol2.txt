Key Differences and Use Cases Between React's Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
Client-Side Rendering (CSR):
Definition: The browser downloads a minimal HTML file, JavaScript bundles, and renders the content dynamically on the client side.
Use Cases:
Interactive Apps: Dashboards, social media platforms, or applications with heavy user interaction.
When SEO is Not Critical: Internal tools or member-only platforms.
Advantages:
Faster navigation after the initial load (SPA behavior).
Less server load.
Challenges:
Poor SEO due to delayed content rendering for crawlers.
Longer initial load times.
Server-Side Rendering (SSR):
Definition: The server renders the React components into HTML before sending it to the browser.
Use Cases:
SEO-Critical Pages: E-commerce product pages, blogs, or news sites.
Fast First Paint: Ensuring content is visible as soon as possible.
Advantages:
Improved SEO (bots receive fully rendered HTML).
Faster first meaningful paint.
Challenges:
Higher server load due to rendering on every request.
Complex implementation for state management and dynamic data fetching.
