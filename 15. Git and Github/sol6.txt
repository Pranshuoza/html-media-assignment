To deploy Tailwind projects like YouTube, Slack, and Gmail clones on GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

Build the Project: Ensure your Tailwind project is built for production. For example:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
Create a Repository:

Go to GitHub.
Create a new repository for each project (YouTube, Slack, Gmail clones).
Push the Code:

Initialize Git and push your project code:
bash
Copy code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <repository_url>
git push -u origin main
Enable GitHub Pages:

Go to the repository settings.
Under "Pages," set the branch to main and save.
Access the Deployed Website:

After a few minutes, your project will be live at https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>.
Repeat for Other Projects: Deploy each project following the same process.
