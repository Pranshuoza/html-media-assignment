Version control is a system that tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to manage and record different versions of a project. It is essential in software development for the following reasons:

Tracking Changes: Maintains a history of modifications, making it easier to track when and why changes were made.
Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts, managing different contributions effectively.
Rollback Capability: Allows reverting to a previous version of the project if something goes wrong.
Branching and Merging: Facilitates experimental development in isolated branches without affecting the main project.
Backup: Acts as a backup system, ensuring code isnâ€™t lost due to hardware failures or mistakes.
