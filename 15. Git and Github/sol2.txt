The Git workflow consists of three main areas:

Working Directory:

The local folder where you make changes to your files.
Changes made here are untracked or modified until staged.
Staging Area (Index):

A temporary area where changes are listed for the next commit.
Files must be added to the staging area before committing.
Command: git add <file>
Repository:

The database where all committed changes are stored permanently.
Once changes are committed, they move from the staging area to the repository.
Command: git commit -m "message"
Workflow Example:

Modify a file in the working directory.
Stage the file using git add.
Commit the changes to the repository using git commit.
