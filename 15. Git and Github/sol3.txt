A .gitignore file specifies files or directories that Git should ignore. This is crucial for version control because:

It prevents unnecessary files (e.g., logs, environment files, compiled binaries) from being added to the repository.
It reduces repository size and improves performance.
It protects sensitive information (e.g., API keys) from being accidentally shared.
