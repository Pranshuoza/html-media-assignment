Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, it allows developers to write server-side applications using JavaScript.

Features of Node.js
Non-blocking I/O: Handles multiple requests concurrently without blocking the main thread.
Single-threaded Event Loop: Uses a single thread to handle many connections asynchronously.
Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Primary Use Cases
Web Servers:

Build scalable web servers with frameworks like Express.js.
Example: REST APIs for web and mobile applications.
Real-Time Applications:

Ideal for chat apps, multiplayer games, and collaboration tools (e.g., Slack, Trello).
Example: WebSocket-based communication.
Microservices:

Suitable for building distributed and microservice-based architectures.
Example: Modularizing business logic in large-scale applications.
Command-Line Tools:

Create CLI tools with access to file systems and network resources.
Example: Build tools like Webpack.
Streaming Applications:

Efficiently handle data streams for video, audio, or large file uploads.
