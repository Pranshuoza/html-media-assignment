Synchronous Operations
Execute tasks one at a time, in a blocking manner.
The execution of the next task waits until the current one completes.
Can lead to performance issues in I/O-heavy applications.
Asynchronous Operations
Execute tasks in a non-blocking manner.
Allow other operations to continue while waiting for a task (e.g., I/O) to complete.
Typically use callbacks, Promises, or async/await.
